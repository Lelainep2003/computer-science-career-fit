                            <p>Computer science is the study of computers and computing, including their theoretical and
                                algorithmic foundations, hardware and software, and their uses for processing
                                information. The
                                discipline of computer science includes the study of algorithms and data structures,
                                computer
                                and network design, modeling data and information processes, and artificial
                                intelligence. </p>
                            <p>Computer science draws some of its foundations from mathematics and engineering and
                                therefore
                                incorporates techniques from areas such as queueing theory, probability and statistics,
                                and
