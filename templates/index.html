                        <p>Computer science is the study of computers and computing, including their theoretical and
                            algorithmic foundations, hardware and software, and their uses for processing information.
                            The
                            discipline of computer science includes the study of algorithms and data structures,
                            computer
                            and network design, modeling data and information processes, and artificial intelligence.
                        </p>
                        <p>Computer science draws some of its foundations from mathematics and engineering and therefore
                            incorporates techniques from areas such as queueing theory, probability and statistics, and
                            electronic circuit design.</p>
